# Hi there :wave:

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sungchian, a data-driven business analyst. I recently completed a Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the University of California, Irvine, where I learned how to apply different analytical tools, such as machine learning models and neural networks, to real-world examples. Before that, I completed a Bachelor's Degree in Medical Informatics and Innovative Applications, which was a hybrid program between Computer Science and Medical Informatics, from the Fu-Jen University in Taiwan, where I learned about business analysis from a business perspective, from communicating with stakeholders and asking the right questions to implement solutions effectively. At the same time, I was working as a full-time Data Engineer at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital for around 2 years. In this role, I applied the knowledge I learned from my academic career and made valuable contributions to the organization, as well as learned new skills.    

So why analytics? Analytics is like creating a narrative for data. It turns the what-seems-to-be-pointless data into valuable information, allowing others to see the story of the dataset. The potential to uncover beneath-the-surface insights that support strategic decision-making is what draws me to business analytics. I hope to empower people and organizations by using data to bridge the gap between business and analytics.

Here are some projects that I have worked on.
